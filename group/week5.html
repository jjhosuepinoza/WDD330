  <h1>
    Testing and Debugging
  </h1>
 <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. A ninja programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to identify and deal with them quickly.</p>
 <br>
   <p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:</p> 
   <li>Errors, exceptions, and warnings</li>

    <li>The importance of testing and debugging</li>
    
    <li>Strict mode </li>
    
    <li>Debugging in the browser</li>
    
    <li>Error objects</li>
    
    <li>Throwing exceptions</li>
    
    <li>Exception handling</li>
    
    <li>Testing frameworks</li>
    
    
  <h2>
    Error Objects
  </h2>
  
  <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>

  <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
  
  <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>
  
  <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
  
  <li>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</li>
  
  <li>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
  
  <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>

    Chapter Summary
  </h2>
<li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>

<li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict". This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>

<li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.</li>

<li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.</li>

<li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.</li>

<li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
<li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>

<li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>

<li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>

<li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>
